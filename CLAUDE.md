# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FRC Team 3200 (Raptacon) robot code for the 2026 season. Written in Python using RobotPy (WPILib's Python bindings) with the Commands2 framework. The robot runs a 4-module MK4i swerve drivetrain with SparkMax motor controllers (REV NEO motors) and CTRE CANcoders.
Note that wpilib is avaiable in C++, Java and python. Most resources are listed as C++ or java but almost all code transfers to python with minor updates to match python nuances and style.

## Build & Development Commands

**Setup (first time):**
```bash
make                    # Creates venv and installs dependencies (uses Makefile)
# OR manually:
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m robotpy sync  # Installs pyproject.toml dependencies to robotpy cache
```

**Run simulator:**
```bash
make sim                # Runs coverage tests then launches simulator
python -m robotpy sim   # Direct simulator launch
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
python -m robotpy test              # Run all tests
python -m robotpy coverage test     # Run tests with coverage (used by CI)
```

**Lint:**
```bash
make lint
# Or directly:
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F6,F7,F8,F4,W1,W2,W4,W5,W6,E11 --ignore W293,W503 --show-source --statistics --exclude */tests/pyfrc*,utils/yaml/*,.venv*/,venv*/,examples/robotpy/*
```

**Deploy to robot:**
```bash
make deploy             # Deploys libraries and code to the robot. (requires robot connection)
python -m robotpy deploy
```

**Run controller config GUI:**
```bash
pip install -r host/requirements.txt   # First time only (Pillow, PyYAML)
# macOS (Homebrew Python only): brew install python-tk
python -m host.controller_config       # Launch GUI
```

**Run controller web editor (Svelte SPA):**
```bash
# One-shot launcher (creates venv, installs deps, opens browser):
scripts/controller_editor/launch.ps1     # Windows
scripts/controller_editor/launch.sh      # macOS / Linux

# Or by hand:
pip install -r host/requirements.txt
python -m host.controller_web_editor   # http://127.0.0.1:8071
```
The launcher scripts auto-install Node (via `winget` on Windows or
`brew` on macOS) and build the SPA on first run.  `static/` is NOT
committed -- the server builds it on startup when `web/src/` is newer
or `static/` is missing.  Setup details, dev workflow, and CI export
instructions in [host/controller_web_editor/README.md](host/controller_web_editor/README.md).

**Style:**
Follow major style guidelines from PEP8 based on what is configured for flake8.

## Architecture

### Entry Point & Robot Lifecycle

`robot.py` defines `MyRobot(commands2.TimedCommandRobot)` running at 20 Hz (50ms period). It delegates all logic to `RobotSwerve` (in `robotswerve.py`), which acts as the **robot container** - it builds a manifest, creates a `SubsystemRegistry`, and exposes convenience accessors. Subsystem creation, telemetry, and controls are handled by the registry via convention-based discovery (see Subsystem Registry below).

`MyRobot.__callAndCatch` wraps periodic calls to catch and log exceptions without crashing the robot on hardware (exceptions are re-raised in simulation).

### Configuration Separation

- **`constants.py`** - Physical hardware constants (robot dimensions, gear ratios, conversion factors, current limits). Uses class inheritance: `RobotConstants` -> `SwerveDriveConsts` -> `SwerveModuleMk4iConsts` -> `SwerveModuleMk4iL2Consts`
- **`config.py`** - Operator-tunable parameters (`OperatorRobotConfig`): PID gains, encoder calibrations, vision thresholds, CAN channel assignments, PathPlanner constraints, default start poses

### Subsystem Registry (`utils/subsystem_factory.py`)

Subsystems are **self-contained and self-registering**. Each subsystem module calls `register_subsystem()` at the bottom of its file. Importing `subsystem` (via `subsystem/__init__.py`) triggers all registrations.

**Key types:**
- `SubsystemEntry` — declares name, default state, creator function, and dependencies
- `SubsystemFactory` — creates a single subsystem with error isolation (required subsystems raise on failure, enabled ones degrade gracefully)
- `SubsystemRegistry` — processes a manifest of entries: resolves NT-persisted state, checks dependencies, creates subsystems, and provides convention-based lifecycle methods

**Convention-based lifecycle:**
- **Controls**: auto-discovers `commands/{name}_controls.py` and calls `register_controls(subsystem, container)`
- **Telemetry**: calls `subsystem.updateTelemetry()` if the method exists
- **Disabled init**: calls `subsystem.onDisabledInit()` if the method exists

**Robot manifests** (`subsystem/manifest.py`): `ROBOT_MANIFESTS` maps robot name strings to manifest builders. Entries are topologically sorted (Kahn's algorithm) so dependencies are created first. Available manifests:
- `"competition"` — all registered subsystems
- `"sparky"` — drivetrain only
- `None` — fallback, defaults to competition

The active robot name is persisted via `ntproperty` at `/robot/name`.

**Adding a new subsystem:**
1. Create subsystem class in `subsystem/` with optional `updateTelemetry()` and `onDisabledInit()` methods
2. Add `register_subsystem()` call at bottom of module
3. Add one import line in `subsystem/__init__.py`
4. Optionally create `commands/{name}_controls.py` with `register_controls(subsystem, container)`

No manifest editing or `robotswerve.py` changes needed.

### Subsystems (`subsystem/`)
Subsystems contain code to control or logically group mechanisms and software components on the robot. Subsystems directly control hardware through the wpilib library.
- **`drivetrain/`** : Contains code for the drivetrain of the robot
- **`drivetrain/swerve_drivetrain.py`** - `SwerveDrivetrain(Subsystem)`: manages 4 swerve modules, gyroscope (NavX), pose estimation (SwerveDrive4PoseEstimator), PathPlanner integration, field-relative drive. Owns a `Field2d` for dashboard visualization. Uses "always blue" coordinate system.
- **`drivetrain/swerve_module.py`** - `SwerveModuleMk4iSparkMaxNeoCanCoder`: individual module with drive motor, steer motor (both SparkMax/NEO via REV), and absolute encoder (CANcoder via Phoenix6). CAN IDs use consecutive numbering: base=drive, base+1=steer, base+2=encoder.
- **`localization/`** : Contains code pertaining to locating the robot physically on the field of play and determining correct goals based on red or blue alliance teams. See `subsystem/localization/VISION.md` for AprilTag detection ranges, viewing angles, filtering thresholds, std dev tuning, and PhotonVision integration best practices.
- **`mechanisms/`** : Contains robot mechanisms such as turrets, flywheel shooters, intakes, hoppers and climbers.

### Commands (`commands/`)
The command folder contains the commands which act on subsystems. Groups of commands can be used to accomplish more complex tasks. Default commands run whenever another command
does not currently require a subsystem and are used for default behaviors or passing driver controls to subsystems.
- **`{name}_controls.py`** - Convention-based control files auto-discovered by the registry. Each exports `register_controls(subsystem, container)` to wire HID bindings and default commands.
- **`default_swerve_drive.py`** - `DefaultDrive`: teleop Xbox controller driving (left stick translate, right stick rotate)
- **`autoDrive.py`** - `AutoDrive`: time-based autonomous drive
- **`auto/pid_to_pose.py`** - `PIDToPose`: profiled PID alignment to target pose
- **`auto/pathplan_to_pose.py`** - `pathplanToPose()`: PathPlanner-based pathfinding to target pose (avoids field obstacles via navgrid)
- **`auto/pathplan_to_path.py`** - PathPlanner path following

### Examples (`examples/`)
This directory contains examples and allows a location to develop new robots.py for limited hardware environments. We will create a new folder for each example robot.py that we may test with which will follow the same structure as the base directory.
- **`robotpy`** : Contains a set of wpilib examples that show how to do certain tasks with the wpilib library.
- **`flywheel-sysid`** : Contains a example of how to collect data to run sysid on various mechanical components.


### Controller Config (`utils/controller/` and `host/controller_config/`)

Shared data model (`utils/controller/model.py`) defines `ActionDefinition`, `ControllerConfig`, and `FullConfig`. Actions use qualified names: `group.name` (e.g. `intake.run`). Input types: BUTTON, ANALOG, OUTPUT, BOOLEAN_TRIGGER, VIRTUAL_ANALOG. D-pad directions are treated as buttons (factory converts POV angle to booleans at runtime). Config stored in `data/controller.yaml`. YAML I/O in `config_io.py`. Portable curve math in `utils/math/curves.py` (shared by robot code and host GUI).

See `host/controller_config/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed GUI architecture and design patterns.

### Input Factory (`utils/input/`)

Config-driven controller input management. `InputFactory` loads YAML config, creates `wpilib.XboxController` instances, and provides `getButton()`, `getAnalog()`, `getRumbleControl()` and raw variants. All managed objects are eagerly created at init so NT entries publish immediately. Analog shaping pipeline: inversion -> deadband -> curve -> scale -> slew rate limit. Parameters published to NT under `/inputs/actions/<group>/<action>/` for runtime tuning; NT sync is automatic each scheduler cycle. Create the factory in `robotInit` **before** subsystems; use `get_factory()` for subsystem-local access.

See `examples/inputFactory/` for a complete working example.

### Camera Visualizer (`host/camera_visualizer/`)

Three.js web app for visualizing robot geometry, CAD models, and FRC fields. Run with `python -m host.camera_visualizer.serve` (serves on localhost:8070). See `host/camera_visualizer/CLAUDE.md` for detailed architecture and design decisions.

**Robot geometry single source of truth:**
- `constants/robot_geometry.py` — robot frame, swerve positions, cameras, mechanism transforms
- `utils/geometry.py` — `transform_from_inches()`, `chain_transforms()`, `CameraGeometry`, `MechanismMount`
- Edit `robot_geometry.py` and refresh browser to see changes (no server restart needed)

### CAD Tools (`host/cad_tools/`)

STEP→GLTF conversion script and storage for robot CAD models. The visualizer reads from `host/cad_tools/models/` (gitignored — large binaries live in a separate team CAD repo). See `host/cad_tools/README.md`.

## Future

- [ ] JSON Schema for controller config YAML validation — IDE autocompletion + red squiggles. `config_io.py` abstraction makes format swaps straightforward.

### CAN ID Convention

Drivetrain modules start at CAN ID 50 with 3 consecutive IDs per module (drive, steer, encoder). Additional mechanisms count backwards from CAN ID 40. CAN IDs 15-19 are reserved for unit tests and must not be used for hardware. See `subsystem/CAN_CONFIG.md`.

## Key Libraries

- `robotpy` 2026.x - WPILib Python bindings
- `robotpy-rev` - REV SparkMax motor controllers
- `phoenix6` - CTRE CANcoder absolute encoders
- `robotpy-navx` - NavX gyroscope
- `robotpy-pathplannerlib` - Autonomous path planning
- `photonlibpy` - PhotonVision camera integration
- `commands2` - WPILib command-based framework
- `robotpy-urcl` - Unoffical library to enable capture of Rev Robotics CAN control frames.

## CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/robot_ci.yml`) runs on Windows:
- Unit tests: `python -m robotpy coverage test`
- Lint (critical): flake8 with select rules for syntax errors and undefined names
- Lint (extra): flake8 with complexity and line-length checks (non-blocking)
- Docstring verification (non-blocking)

## Unit Tests
 - Unit tests should be encouraged and written
 - Unit tests generated by Claude should be commented as such
 - Unit tests should use sim feedback when working with hardware based devices
 - Prefer pytest style (plain classes + `assert`) over `unittest.TestCase` — pyfrc/robotpy uses pytest as its test runner

## NetworkTables

**Prefer `ntproperty` over `SmartDashboard`** for publishing subsystem state. `ntproperty` creates proper NT entries under the subsystem's own path (e.g. `/SubsystemName/value`) and is the standard pattern for this codebase. Avoid `wpilib.SmartDashboard.putString/putNumber` in subsystems — it puts values under `/SmartDashboard/` which doesn't organize well and doesn't create a proper subsystem NT entry. During code reviews, flag any `SmartDashboard.put*` in subsystem code as something to convert to `ntproperty`.

**Persistence:** Use `ntproperty` with `persistent=True` and `writeDefault=False` for values that need to persist across reboots (calibration data, saved positions, etc.) so existing persisted values are not overwritten on startup:

```python
from ntcore.util import ntproperty

class MySubsystem:
    saved_limit = ntproperty('/MySubsystem/saved_limit', 0.0,
                             writeDefault=False, persistent=True)
```

**Non-persistent state:** Use `ntproperty` with `writeDefault=True` (default) for runtime telemetry that doesn't need to persist:

```python
class MySubsystem:
    status = ntproperty('/MySubsystem/status', 'unknown', writeDefault=True)
```

See `examples/nt-persistence-test/` for a comparison of persistence approaches.

## WPILib Upstream Development

### Repository & Fork

- **Upstream:** `wpilibsuite/allwpilib` — the main WPILib C++/Java/Python library
- **Our fork:** `tuffinmuffin/allwpilib` — cloned to `/Users/nbeasley/FRC/allwpilib`
- **Docs:** WPILib docs are at https://docs.wpilib.org — source code docs are sparse, mostly inline comments
- **Contribution policy:** BSD-3 license, no CLA required. Bug fixes generally accepted. Must pass `wpiformat` and `./gradlew check`.

### Key Directories in allwpilib

- `simulation/halsim_gui/` — Simulation GUI (driver station, joysticks, hardware viz)
- `hal/` — Hardware Abstraction Layer
- `wpigui/` — GLFW-based GUI framework used by halsim_gui
- `wpilib/` — Main WPILib library (Java)
- `wpimath/` — Math utilities
- `cscore/` — Camera support (has Objective-C++ examples for macOS patterns)

### Building & Installing (macOS)

Requires Java 17 (Gradle 8.x does not support Java 25):

```bash
brew install openjdk@17
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH"

cd /Users/nbeasley/FRC/allwpilib
./gradlew :simulation:halsim_gui:build
```

Built binary: `simulation/halsim_gui/build/libs/halsim_gui/shared/osxuniversal/release/libhalsim_gui.dylib`

**Installing into robotpy venv:**

**The allwpilib branch must match your robotpy version to avoid ABI mismatches.**
Check `pyproject.toml` for the robotpy version (e.g. `2026.2.1`) and build from the matching tag (e.g. `v2026.2.1`).

```bash
# Back up original
cp venv/lib/python3.*/site-packages/halsim_gui/lib/libhalsim_gui.dylib \
   venv/lib/python3.*/site-packages/halsim_gui/lib/libhalsim_gui.dylib.bak

# Install built binary
cp /Users/nbeasley/FRC/allwpilib/simulation/halsim_gui/build/libs/halsim_gui/shared/osxuniversal/release/libhalsim_gui.dylib \
   venv/lib/python3.*/site-packages/halsim_gui/lib/libhalsim_gui.dylib

# Restore original
cp venv/lib/python3.*/site-packages/halsim_gui/lib/libhalsim_gui.dylib.bak \
   venv/lib/python3.*/site-packages/halsim_gui/lib/libhalsim_gui.dylib
```

### Code Style

- C++ formatting: run `wpiformat` (install via `pip install wpiformat`)
- `wpiformat` needs `git remote set-head origin main` if origin/HEAD is not set
- Gradle spotless checks run automatically during build
